# StandupSync

StandupSync is a Python-based application that aims to automate the process of generating meeting transcripts and extracting important insights and tasks from daily standup meetings in offices. It utilizes speech-to-text conversion and a language model to provide an efficient and convenient solution for teams.

## Track - LLM API Endpoint

## Problem Statement
- Lack of comprehensive software for tracking and analyzing Daily Stand-Up Meetings (DSMs).
- Challenges in improving collaboration and individual contributions without systematic DSM insights. 
- Difficulty in identifying areas of improvement and tracking bug origins. 
- Manual analysis of DSMs leading to inefficiency in resource utilization. 
- Limited ability to generate actionable insights and performance metrics from DSM discussions.
- Difficulty in tracking meeting insights and providing timely feedback.

## Solution 
- Implemented routes and endpoints within the Flask-based API to handle audio processing, insights extraction, and summary generation. 
- Integrate the DSM transcription module to convert audio recordings into text using Azure speech-to-text API.
- Utilize the GPT API for natural language processing tasks and analysis..
- The API is fluent in US-English, Spanish and majority of our Indic-Regional languages as well.
- Seamlessly integrate with team members' Google Calendars to automatically add notes and reminders based on extracted DSM insights.

## Workflow
- User selects the preferred language.
- User chooses the audio input source (Microphone or Audio Stream).
- Audio is recorded and saved as a WAV file.
- Speech-to-text conversion is performed using the selected language and Azure Speech Recognition API.
- The transcribed text is processed using the GPT API to extract insights, summaries, and action items.
- The resulting text is sent to Google Calendar for event creation and notification.
- Enabling weekly analysis based on Google Calendar data.

## Tech Stack/ Methodology
- Python: For server-side development.
- Flask: For building the API server.
- OpenAI GPT API: For Natural Language Processing and Text Generation.
